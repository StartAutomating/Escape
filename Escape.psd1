### Escape Sequences

Escape sequences are a nearly unavoiable part of technology.

We often need to escape strings into other formats
(like putting `<` or `>` inside of HTML).

We also often need to use more obscure escape sequences to adjust terminal settings.

Escape is a collection of escape sequences, and the way to escape having to remember them.

### Escape Architecture

Escape is a collection of scripts that make escape sequences.

It has a relatively simple architecture:

* Each script resides in `./Types/Escape.Sequence`.
* All scripts are compiled into ScriptMethods by [EZOut](https://github.com/StartAutomating/EZout).
* `Get-Escape` exposes all of these scripts with natural syntax
* `Get-Escape` is aliased to `escape` and `esc` for easier-to-read syntax

### Escape Contributions

While Escape has over a hundred sequences, it is nowhere near a _complete_ collection.
