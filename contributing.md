This project is meant to be a functional and universal reference of how to escape content and make escape sequences.

While it has quite a few, there are quite surely many more things we can escape.

If you know of anything to include, please [file an issue](https://github.com/StartAutomating/Escape) and consider opening a pull request with a fix.

Please put any new escape sequences beneath `./Types/Escape.Sequence`, and only check in the `.ps1` file for the escape sequence.

To build locally, download [EZOut](https://github.com/StartAutomating/EZOut) and run `./Build/Escape.ezout`.
